1. I was able to implement the arithmetic Identity (partially), multiplication by zero,
and multiplicative identity. I also implemented the unittest for the individual functions, including the
combined test. I don't know why, but I also included my test cases in the commits (sorry).


2. I learned to not trust chat gpt to generate test cases. Of course the one time I decide to use it to make my work a little easier, I waste A LOT of time looking for a nonexistent bug. I seriously learned the value of having good tests, along with an automated tester. I will undoubtedly add this type of unit testing to my workflow with safer practices, like making my own test.


3. At first I was having a hard time grasping how the AST data structure worked which caused a lot of bugs while trying to implement. Anyways, the most annoying bug I encountered was with the additive identity. In the case where the addition was stacked, the function wouldn't do anything.Overall, the recursive calls also tripped me up, but it eventually all made sense.

# ;;> Glad it eventually made sense! This type of thing is something that only comes with practice for most of us
